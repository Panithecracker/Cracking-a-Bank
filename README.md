## Introduction (read it)
I stumbled across this problem and due to its brief and innocent looking description, I was incited to give it a shot. After some time, I succesfully solved it. However, the most enjoyable part was everything that happened before knowing I was right...Stopping to ponder about the premise of the problem and maximize the value of the information given, I surely had lots of aha moments, which came from taking different viewing angles of the context . Additionally, throughout this creative process I learned how to use backtracking recursive algorithms to project some combinatorial ideas that simply scratch the surface of the solution approach I took  to tackle the problem. **Please, do not ruin this project by looking up at my solution instantly. Take your on approach and then compare it with mine, to potentially contribute to a better solution.**

# PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
# Are you able to crack a bank account password?
*A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three random characters from a passcode.*
***For example, if the passcode was 531278, they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be: 317**.The text file, **keylog.txt**, contains fifty successful login attempts.*
*Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse the file so as to determine the **shortest** possible secret passcode of unknown length.*
